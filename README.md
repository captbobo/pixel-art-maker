---------- 

This is first web app I built. Many thanks to the people at Google and Udacity. 

If you like it let me know; If you don't like it let me know even further. 

<strong><em>Any feedback will be much appreciated!</em></strong>

----------

I tried to:
- be efficient, and concise.
- write scalable code, so that new features can be added rather easily
- avoid using any hacks, shortcuts etc. I hope it is as efficient as I think it is.
- use abstraction as much as possible.

Please check out the code and let me know what you think!

# future of this pixel-art maker

Many others from the Google Udacity FEND(Front-End) Scholarship Phase-1 has delivered amazing pixel-art makers. 

I was influenced by those guys to a certain degree. I still have a to-do list for this project and I will come back at in my spare time. 

Some of those ideas:

- make it mobile! 
- add saving and sharing features
- add/write a better color-picker (responsive and compatible!)

Sorry if the README is dull, this is my first! veeuu
